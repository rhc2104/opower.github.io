    <p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario:</p>

<p>You cruise in to the office at 8:45, get your coffee, check the reddits, and ignore that email from your parents asking if their computer picked up a virus because McAfee won&rsquo;t stop popping up a tooltray icon helpfully informing them that they&rsquo;re totally vulnerable.  Right around 9:15, you get motivated to tackle that 2 point user story for the current iteration.</p>

<p>You head over to the wiki, check out the specs for the requirement, find out what the Trac ticket number is and see if there are any comments with last minute advice or dependencies.  None?  Good. . . let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<p>Oh, huh&hellip; it&rsquo;s 9:40.  There&rsquo;s that all-hands meeting at 10 o&rsquo;clock.  I <em>could</em> get started, but I&rsquo;m not really going to get anything done in 20 minutes really&hellip; and that link to the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/akdobbins/three-keyboard-cat-moon-shirt">keyboard-cat-three-wolf-t-shirt</a> <em>did</em> look interesting.</p>

<p>The 10 o&rsquo;clock meeting runs a little long, and then there&rsquo;s the lunch train, and suddenly it&rsquo;s the afternoon and you haven&rsquo;t been in The Zone once.</p>

<h3 id="the-zone">The Zone</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been in The Zone &ndash; that magical place where time appears to stop and you rock out an insane amount of code in what seems like 10 minutes, but when you look up from your keyboard the sun is down and the cleaning crew is giving you a weird look because you didn&rsquo;t realize you were trying to sing along to Sigur Ros.</p>

<p>Trying to force yourself into The Zone is like trying to force yourself to see through those <a href="http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload//0000/000/90/4/94.gif">stereograms</a> (hint: it&rsquo;s always a Schooner).  And as hard as it is to get <em>in</em> The Zone, it&rsquo;s annoying easily to get <em>out</em> of The Zone.</p>

<p>There are a lot of recommendations out there to help create &ldquo;zone-friendly&rdquo; work places including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>separate offices</li>
  <li>ambient music</li>
  <li>leaving something intentionally broken the night before to give you that excuse to dive in the next morning</li>
  <li><a href="http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload//0000/000/90/4/94.gif">shift your tasks to the upper right</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Paul Graham&rsquo;s thoughts</a> on the matter</li>
  <li>etc. etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were wrapping up our all-hands meeting yesterday when the ever-perceptive Dave noted that our weekly meeting schedules were really not all that Zone-Friendly.  With a couple of exceptions, we had standing meetings along the following schedule:</p>

<p><img src="/img/zone_unfriendly.png" alt="Standing Meetings" /></p>

<p>And keep in mind, that&rsquo;s just the standing meetings, so it&rsquo;s the bare-minimum one would expect.  Now let&rsquo;s add some &ldquo;procrastination shading&rdquo; to that calendar to demonstrate the actual standing meeting impact:</p>

<p><img src="/img/zone_unfriendly_shaded.png" alt="Standing Meetings" /></p>

<p>If we shuffled some meetings around (especially around the meat of the middle of the week), I think we could end up &ldquo;finding&rdquo; 2 or 3 hours a week more conducive to The Zone:</p>

<p><img src="/img/zone_friendly_shaded.png" alt="Friendly Standing Meetings" /></p>

<p>Of course, this is an idealized example, but it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re thinking about and playing with.</p>

<p>What do you guys out there in development land do?  Any recommendations of particular effectiveness?</p>

    <p>NEW LAW FOR DEVELOPERS:</p>

<p><em>If you throw an exception about some connection being refused, you&rsquo;d better damn well put what connection you were attempting to make in the exception message.</em></p>

<p>What inspired this law?  Thanks for asking.</p>

<p>Check out this snippet in the middle of an 80 line stack dump:</p>

<pre><code>2009-08-25 17:23:42.373::WARN:  Nested in org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'coreAutopatcher' defined in class path resource [config/migrationContext.xml]: Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is com.tacitknowledge.util.migration.MigrationException: Error applying patches:
com.mchange.v2.resourcepool.CannotAcquireResourceException: A ResourcePool could not acquire a resource from its primary factory or source.
at com.mchange.v2.resourcepool.BasicResourcePool.awaitAvailable(BasicResourcePool.java:1319)

at com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.C3P0PooledConnectionPool.checkoutPooledConnection(C3P0PooledConnectionPool.java:525)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;A ResourcePool could not acquire a resource from its primary factory or source&rdquo;.  Awesome.  Sooo helpful.  /wristsemoragegrowl</p>

<p>Also, a WARN?  Seriously?  You&rsquo;re a connection pool.  Do you think not connecting to your underlying datasource warrants maybe something as stern as an ERROR?  Or, heaven forbid, a FATAL?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I could have turned up logging somewhere, but I noticed Spring&rsquo;s DelegatingDataSource bean standing out from among the stack lines and set a break point on its called method to figure out exactly which of my many connections was unable to be resolved:</p>

<p><img src="/img/what_am_i_connecting_to.png" alt="what_am_i_connecting_to" /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the culprit!  <code>localhost:5455</code>.  You know, whoever the idiot is who runs that localhost server needs to get his act together.  I should call the guys from YouTube and have them do a Maury Povich-style video expose on why he can&rsquo;t keep any of his connections stable.</p>

    <p>I am relatively new to Subversion &ndash; well, two years into using it now, but this is the first project I have used it on.  Subversion, like any tool, has its quirks and works best when you really know how to use it.  When I started, I treated the &ldquo;trunk/branches/tags&rdquo; directory structure exactly like a directory structure.  It took me a little playing around until I stumbled on what I would call a best practice.  When I checkout a new project, I do it like so:</p>

<pre><code>svn co http://domain.com/svnroot/project/trunk project
</code></pre>

<p>That way, when I go to the <code>project</code> directory, I do not have to then go into the <code>trunk</code> directory to get to my files.  Saving an extra directory level is not the best benefit though.  When I set up my IDE (yes, I use an IDE), I put the IDE files in that one directory and do not have to recreate them for each branch or tag that I might check out.  I essentially treat the &ldquo;trunk/branches/tags&rdquo; part of the directory as pure metadata, which makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p>When I switched over to this system, there was one big drawback.  I could not easily tell where I am just by looking at my prompt.  I had to run <code>svn info | grep URL</code> to see if I was on a branch.  So instead of letting my prompt handicap me, I decided to get smart about my prompt.  Using bash, my prompt used to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>jeff:/opt/pose/main/report/src/main/java
</code></pre>

<p>but now it looks like this (supercharged with Subversion metadata):</p>

<pre><code>jeff:/opt/pose/main/report/src/main/java [SVN: /main/report/trunk]
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m no bash expert, so I dug around on the web and learned a bit about how <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> works.  Here is what I have in my <code>.bash_profile</code> now:</p>

<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PROMPT_COMMAND</span><span class="o">=</span>spwd

<p>It may not be the most efficient way to do it, but it sure works well and lets me know in an instant what trunk, branch or tag I happen to be working on at that very moment.</p>

    <p>We&rsquo;re still too small of a company to have more than 1 or 2 logical groupings of the development team, and before today they&rsquo;ve been basically &ldquo;the web team&rdquo; and &ldquo;everyone else.&rdquo;  Of course, there&rsquo;s a lot of cross-pollination and everything nowadays ultimately manifests itself somehow as &ldquo;&lsquo;web&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Still, the &ldquo;everyone else&rdquo; paint brush was wearing thin.  In addition to the &ldquo;web team&rdquo;, we had &ldquo;the scale team&rdquo; (a.k.a &ldquo;Ops R&amp;D&rdquo;) and &ldquo;the AMI team&rdquo; and &ldquo;the core team&rdquo; and &ldquo;the report team&rdquo;. . .but most of those were &ldquo;teams&rdquo; averaged size 1 and their membership varied from iteration-to-iteration.</p>

<p>Sick of referring to ourselves with a hand-wave and a &ldquo;you-know. . .the non-web-team,&rdquo; I plugged our names in to an acronym engine and we found the perfect name for ourselves:</p>

<p><strong><em>The Cheated Frogs of Vim</em></strong></p>

<p>While I put in my fair share of vi time in previous development gigs, I&rsquo;m a little too fond of modern debuggers to go whole-hog with Vim as my &ldquo;IDE.&rdquo;  Dave, on the other hand, is pretty hard-core with his Vim skills, so our new team name may have some sticking power.</p>

<p>Our wizard graphics guy even cooked up a logo for us:</p>
