    <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when everything was dark. Everything was
dark except for a few rapidly moving glyphs that none could really understand.
None could understand except for a few elders who had spent months of studying.</p>

<p><em>Terminals, tiny fonts, hadoop command lines and hbase scans.</em></p>

<p>The elders were wise but, in their learnings, they forgot what it was like to
<em>not</em> understand. They had forgotten what it was like before they finally
developed the ability to decipher it.</p>

<p>So it was in much frustration that they tried to share with the villagers the
meanings of these cryptic glyphs. They waved their hands, talked slowly and in
exhaustive details about what they saw. But the villagers weren&rsquo;t seeing anything.
Nothing would do. They would stare in the darkness, not seeing the glyphs,
not interested. They would then stand up and walk away not knowing what they had been looking at.</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s just hard to show Big Data to the non-initiated in a compelling way.</em></p>

<p>The elders, sitting on their stools, wondered how they could get the villagers
interested. How could they ignite the fire of curiosity so that they too would
want to learn about these great things?</p>

<p><em>This might have happened on <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">campfire</a></em>.</p>

<p>One elder who had a funny accent was listening but didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s me, I&rsquo;m a <strong>Québécois</strong></em>.</p>

<p>The next morning, when everyone was busy working, he said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear friends, I have listened to you and I have a plan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;I will make them interested if you give me your full trust and support.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A 4 story point JIRA ticket.</em></p>

<p>The others elders looked at him, puzzled.</p>

<p>They all offered their trust and the strange one told them what his plan was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;I will first build the tools that will record all of what is happening.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Such as a java command-line tool that polls the jobtracker for job progress</em>
<em>as well as counters + another one that polls and records the table sizes.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;I will then summon the gods to make it rain the heaviest rain while the
tools record the history.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A full test workflow executed via our runner runs while the tools record data</em>
<em>about it.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;When the rain stops, I will gather the fruits from the tools and I will
arrange a grandiose spectacle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A d3 visual animation of the jobs running overlaid with bars showing the</em>
<em>tables growing as the map/reduce jobs progress.</em></p>

<p>Finally, he added</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;The villagers will gather on the afternoon of the last Tuesday of the 6th
month to attend a showing of this majestic production.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A video montage adding some jest to the whole extravaganza.</em></p>

<p>The elders cheered, albeit slightly skeptical at first.</p>

<p>After 7 days of uninterrupted work, it was ready. The elders and the villagers
gathered around the stage where everything was ready for all eyes to see. The
strange one was absent but the elders proceeded, both anxious and excited.</p>

<p><em>Demo day was on June 25th but I was on vacation so the team had to present</em>
<em>the video.</em></p>

<p>When the beautiful bright sight started before their eyes, the villages stood
silent. The elders watched as everyone was all ears, eyes wide open seemingly
seeing for the first time what this was all about. They did not understand it
immediately. They couldn&rsquo;t have. But when this was done, they asked to watch
it again. They reached to the elders to learn more about what it was that they
had seen. Some stayed and got interested enough to learn some of the glyphs.
The villagers talked for a while and came back to the elders with a reward.</p>

<p><em>People were genuinely entertained, some people asked questions and some might</em>
<em>now think that this thing they weren&rsquo;t sure what it was about looks pretty</em>
<em>interesting.</em></p>

<p>And so, it started…</p>
